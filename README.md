# Deepsteg

Deepsteg is based off of daniellerch's package Aletheia.

## Current Deepsteg Goals:
 - create a training set of images that have hidden data using steghide, rgb, train neural network to detect steghide steganography
 
## What is Aletheia?

Aletheia is an open source image steganalysis tool for the detection of hidden messages in images. To achieve its objectives, Aletheia uses state-of-the-art machine learning techniques. It is capable of detecting several different steganographic methods as for example LSB replacement, LSB matching and some kind of adaptive schemes.
